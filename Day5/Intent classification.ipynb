all start when the emperor marcianu interf with matter of faith in the church the respons of st dioscoru the pope of alexandria who wa later exil to thi interfer wa clear you have noth to do with the

christ ha onli on natur the divin not two natur the human as well as the divin the coptic church ha never believ in monophysit the wai it wa portrai in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysit meant believ in on natur copt believ that the lord is perfect in hi divin and he is perfect in hi human but hi divin and hi human were unit in on natur call the natur of the incarn word which wa reiter by st cyril of alexandria copt thu believ in two natur human and divin that ar unit in on without mingl without confus and without alter from the declar of faith at the end of the

statement to establish a definit proposit an argument consist of three stage first of all the proposit which ar necessari for the argument to continu ar state these ar call the premis of the argument thei ar the evid or reason for accept the argument and it conclus premis or assert ar often indic by phrase such as becaus sinc obvious and so on the phrase obvious is often view with suspicion as it can be us to intimid other into accept suspici premis if someth doesn t seem obviou to you don t be afraid to question it you can alwai sai oh ye you re right it is obviou when you ve heard the explan

the proposit arriv at by infer mai then be us in further infer infer is often denot by phrase such as impli that or therefor final we arriv at the conclus of the argument the proposit which is affirm

argument ar not valid or invalid howev we can talk about whether thei ar better or wors than other argument and about how probabl their premis ar there ar form of argument in ordinari languag which ar

the structur of logic argument would requir lengthi discuss of linguist and philosophi it is simpler and probabl more us to summar the major pitfal to be avoid when construct an argument these pitfal ar known as fallaci in everydai english the term fallaci is us to refer to mistaken belief as well as to the faulti reason that lead to those belief thi is fair enough but in logic the term is gener us to refer to a form of technic incorrect argument especi if the argument appear valid or convinc so for the purpos of thi discuss we defin a fallaci as a logic argument which appear to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examin more close by studi fallaci we aim to avoid be misl by them the follow list of fallaci is not intend to be exhaust argumentum ad baculum appeal to forc the appeal to forc is commit when the arguer resort to forc or the threat of forc in order to try and push the accept of a conclus it is often us by politician and can be summar as might make right the forc threaten need not be a direct threat from the arguer for exampl thu there is ampl proof of the truth of the bibl all those who refus to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is liter argument direct at the man the abus varieti of argumentum ad hominem occur when instead of try to disprov the truth of an assert the arguer attack the person or

food how can you argu otherwis when you re quit happi to wear leather shoe thi is an abus charg of inconsist us as an excus for dismiss the oppon s argument thi fallaci can also be us as a mean of

form from selfish interest is also known as poison the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium mean argument from ignor thi fallaci occur whenev it is argu that someth must be true

note that thi fallaci doe not appli in a court of law where on is gener assum innoc until proven guilti also in scientif investig if it is known that an event would produc certain evid of it have occur the absenc of such evid can validli be us to infer that the event did not occur for exampl a flood as describ in the bibl would requir an enorm volum of water to be present on the earth the earth doe not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ic at the pole therefor no such flood occur in scienc we can validli assum from lack of evid that someth ha not occur we cannot conclud with certainti that it ha not occur howev argumentum ad misericordiam thi is the appeal to piti also known as special plead the fallaci is commit when the arguer appeal to piti for the sake of get a conclus accept for exampl i did not murder my mother and father with an ax pleas don t find me guilti i m suffer enough through be an orphan argumentum ad populum thi is known as

for exampl pornographi must be ban it is violenc against women the bibl must be true million of peopl know that it is ar you try to tell them that thei ar all mistaken fool argumentum ad numeram thi

question whether he is well qualifi to speak on the subject of machin intellig the fallaci of accid the fallaci of accid is commit when a gener rule is appli to a particular case whose accident

anoth meet hall and yell at the cop becaus the loudspeak wa disturb their meet so the loudspeak wa disconnect so thei found a bigger hall upstair on of us had to leav to catch hi charter bu and so miss the public testimoni the other got a seat thi time caron began by talk about how he got hi fid year ago left the state and then return without notifi them of hi address chang he complain that the state record system wa not up to date and that hi pd back in hi citi of birth still thought he live there great quot if you purchas a gun todai it will not get into the state comput system until thi wa also an argument he us against the renew fid card testimoni wa heard from sever batter women on of whom had been attack by some gui in hi s who had an fid card becaus he got it when he wa or thereabout thei us a lot of emot and said how thei were scare of these men a staffer of attornei gener harshbarg testifi in favor of thi anti gun bill sai how restrain order were grant last year and how these women need to be protect caron note that a restrain order wa grant for dai and then a hear wa held to determin whether the order would be extend to a year he ask whether she would be satisfi if the fid were revok at the time of thi hear rather than after the initi issuanc of the fid she gave some long rambl circumlocut in respons then testimoni against the bill wa heard mike yacino who look someth like einstein got up and made the point that restrain order were issu on too littl evid that judg like to issu restrain order just to let thing cool off no matter who thei think is right man or woman and that the hear for restrain order ar lightn session with littl time to consid fact atti karen mcnutt spoke with him a few time dure hi testimoni other pro gunner got up to testifi on said he had had to file a restrain order against a tenant to clear her out and that she counter by file on against him he note that thi would have allow the state to confisc hi gun if the new bill becam law on of the junior rep note that thi is america and we have to be certain that individu right ar respect senat jujuga reiter thi sai that peopl who abus smaller peopl can go to hell as far as i care but we have to be care about equat convict with a restrain order point and match senat anoth pro gunner got up and testifi that he didn t know hi citizenship expir everi year and that a driver s licens wa a privileg not a right like the right to keep and bear arm a third got up and said the problem wa with the crimin justic system and argu in favor of a death penalti bill and public hang senat jujuga said he had himself tri to get a death penalti bill pass and joke respond that he too favor public hang the speaker then respond i ll make you a deal you get me the rope and i ll tie the noos next came public testimoni on the simon s rock bill a teacher testifi that she had been the teacher of wayn lo and that he wouldn t have been abl to shoot peopl insid a build while he wa outsid without hi evil gun she said that the loophol should be close to prevent someth like thi from ever happen again four or five other kid testifi in favor of thi bill on of spill tear for the good legisl on of the student actual shot by wayn lo wa also there mani of them had t shirt on sai as long as on person can bui a gun in anger none of us ar safe support gun control the committe wa reluct to

he had been con into testifi for a bill that would cut out of stater complet off yacino and mcnutt spoke again thi time note that the bill as written would affect both ammo and all gun possess by out of stater karen also note that hunter in ct nh and vt could be put awai for a year if thei wander across the ma boundari somewher in the wood and got challeng by game warden yacino underscor the fact that lo could have gotten an fid as a resid student and hell even an ccw as he had no crimin or mental record on junior rep wa upset that it would take ma resid longer to bui a gun than out of stater and thought it wa elitist anoth caron said that we need the protect of prevent non resid from bui without an fid becaus onli two other state in the union had fid type card so compli with all the law of on s home state wa not enough on pro gun speaker repli that thi resembl a mother watch her son in a march band and exclaim everyon s out of step but johnni all the bard colleg peopl were file out

made no comment on who is right or who is wrong onli that civilian ar be us as cover and that have been place in between the isra and the guerilla thei will be injur as both parti continu their fight the purpos of an armi s us of militari uniform is to set it member apart from the civilian so that civilian will not be thought of by the other side as combat so what do you think is the mean behind the intent and the effect when an armi purpos doe not were uniform but goe out of it wai to look like civilian thei ar judg that the benefit thei will receiv from thi cover is more import that the harm that will come to civilian thi is a comment on the isra experi and is sai that the guerilla do have some respons in put civilian in the middl of thi fight by put on uniform and live apart from civilian barrack etc the guerilla would significantli lower the risk to civilian but if the guerilla do thi aren t thei put themselv at greater risk absolut thei ask themselv why set ourselv apart by wear uniform when there is a readi made cover for us civilian that make sens from their point of view but when thi cover is us the guerilla should accept some of the respons for subsequ harm to civilian if the buffer zone is to prevent attack on israel is it not work why is it further neccessari for isra gun to pound lebanes villag why not just kill those who try to infiltr the buffer zone you see there is more to the shell of the villag it is call retali get back get even it doesn t make sens to shell the villag the least it show is a reckless disregard by the isra govern for the live of civilian i agre with you here i have alwai thought that israel s bomb sorte and bomb polici is stupid thoughtless inhuman and ineffect but there is no reason that israel should passiv wait until attack chose to act there is everi reason to believ that take the fight to the enemi will do more to stop attack as i said previous israel spent sever decad sit passiv on it side of a border and onli act to stop these attack after the attack had enter isra territori it didn t work veri well the host arab state did littl noth to try and stop these attack from it side of the border with israel so the number of attack were consider higher as wa their physic and psycholog impact on the civilian caught in their path what so the whole bit about attack on israel from neighbor arab state can start all over again while i also hope for thi to happen it will onli occur when arab state show that thei ar prepar to take on the respons and the duti to stop guerilla attack on israel from their soil thei have to prove it or provid some guarate there is no wai israel is go to accept their word not with their past attitud of toler toward anti israel guerilla in resid if israel is not will to accept the word of other then imho it ha no busi wast other time come to the peac talk thi is just anoth select appli statement the reason for thi drawn out impass between abab palestinian and isra is that neither side is will to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyon should stai awai from the negoti that is precis why the palestinian in their recent pisga propos for the interim period after negoti and lead up to full autonomi ar demand condit that essenti defin autonomi alreadi thei do not trust that israel will follow through the entir process and allow palestinian to reach full autonomi do you understand and accept thi viewpoint by the palestinian if you do then why should israel s view of arab palestinian be ani differ why should thei trust the arab palestinian word sinc thei don t thei ar veri reluct to give up tangibl asset land control of area in exchang for word for thi reason thei ar also concern about the sort of guarante thei will have that the arab will follow

the caus for war and disarm the hizbollah will remov the caus for it continu occup absolut so ar the arab palestinian ask first for the isra word in relat to ani agreement no what is be demand first is land when the issu is land and on parti final get hold of thi land what the other parti doe is total irrelev if i now have possess of thi land your word have absolut no power whether israel choos

execut thi is object a murder howev who is at blame is anoth question it seem that the entir societi that sanction ani sort of execut realiz the risk is to blame there is a probabl of kill an innoc person by shoot at random into the air and there is a probabl of kill an innoc person when the state administ a system of capit punish so when you do either you know that thei action you ar take will sooner or later result in the kill of an innoc person ye but there is also a probabl that you will kill someon do ani raondom activ presum you had not isol yourself total from the rest of societi becaus of thi and drive will kill peopl as will airlin but peopl continu to do both drive and fly ar not punish inflict on unwil prison by court thei ar risk that we take upon ourselv willingli and i argu that our law system is a similar risk perhap an innoc person will be punish somedai but we work to prevent thi in fact mani crimin go free as a result of our try to prevent punish of innoc if our own drive kill someon els then sure there is a moral issu i know at least on person who wa involv in a fatal accid and thei felt vei guilti afterward but such accid ar to be total expect given the numner of vehic on the road again the blame is on societi no i m not thi is what you said you were sai that if there were such a fals wit that result in an innoc person be convict and kill it would still be the fault of the state sinc it did the actual kill no i just comment that the state doe the kill it doe not depend on there be fals wit how could it the state doe the kill even in the case of sincer mistak ye but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can onli do so much to prevent fals wit it is possibl so what ar you try to sai that capit punish is alwai murder becaus of the possibilti of human error invalid the system i m sai capit punish is murder period not becaus of thi that and the other but becaus it involv take human life that s my definit of murder i make no appeal to dictionari or to object moral okai so thi is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such murder ar wrong ar you sai that all take of human life is wrong no matter what the circumst if we as a societi decid to murder someon then we should sai that and list our reason for do so and live with the moral consequ we should not plai word game and pretend that murder isn t murder and that s my opinion about how societi ought to be run but thi is basic how it work societi accept the risk that an innoc person will be murder by execut and everi member of societi share thi blame and most peopl s definit of murder includ some sort of malici intent which is not involv in an execut is it but we were try to discuss an object moral system or at least it possibilti what ramif doe your person system have on an object on no we were not discuss an object moral system i wa show you that you didn t have on becaus for on thing you were incap of defin the term in it for exampl murder murder violat the golden rule execut do not becaus by allow it at all societi implicitli accept the consequ no matter who the innoc victim is we re not talk about read mind we ar just talk about know the truth ye we can never be absolut certain that we have the truth but the court system work on a principl of know the truth beyond a reason doubt sorri but you simpli ar not quot yourself accur here is what you said and sinc we ar look total object at thi case then we know what peopl ar think when thei ar vote to execut the person or not if the intent is malici and unfair then the execut would be murder what you ar do now is to slide into anoth claim which is quit differ the juri be persuad beyond a seriou doubt is not the same as us know what is in their mind beyond a seriou doubt read the mind of the juri would certainli tell whether or not a convict wa moral or not but in an object system onli the absolut truth matter and the juri system is on method to approxim such a truth that is twelv member must be convinc of a truth moreov a juri which come from a suffici prejud background mai allow itself to be persuad beyond a seriou doubt on evid that you and i would laugh at but then if we read the mind of these peopl we would know that the convict wa unfair but would it be perfectli fair if we could read mind if we assum that it would be fair if we knew the absolut truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we onli have a good approxim of the absolut truth it s not a question of fair your claim which i have quot abov is a claim about whether we can know it wa fair so as to be abl to distinguish capit punishn from murder ye while we could object determin the differ if we knew all possibl inform we can t alwai determin the differ in our flaw system i think that our system is almost as good as possibl but it still isn t object perfect you see it doesn t matter if we know it is fair or not object it is either fair or it is not now there s a huge differ if we can read mind we can know and if we cannot read mind we can know noth the differ is not in degre of fair but in what we can know but what we know ha no effect on an object system i think it is possibl to produc a fairli object system if we ar clear on which goal it is suppos to promot i m not go to wast my time try to devis a system that i am pretti sure doe not exist why ar you so sure i simpli want peopl to confront realiti my realiti rememb why is your realiti import in thi case the realiti is that ideal theori apart we can never know even after the fact about the fair of the justic system for everi innoc person releas from death row there mai have been a dozen innoc peopl execut or a hundr or none at all we simpli don t know but we can assum that the system is fairli decent at least most like and you realiz that the correct of our system sai noth about a total ideal and object system now what ar we go to do on the on hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theori and that we can know thing we can never know and the justi system is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain type of kill not murder and go on our wai well we can have an ideal system but the work system can not be ideal we can onli hope to creat a system that is as close an approxim to the ideal system as possibl on the other hand we can recogn that all justic ha a small we

comment how much histori ha toni campello read not much it seem the arguement he us i am sum up the book is about whether jesu wa god or not i know mani of you don t believ but listen to a differ perspect for we all have someth to gain by listen to what other have to sai it is good to hear that there ar a few reason christian about if onli those christian scientist would take note in australia there is a veri strong movement a bunch of christian scientist who believ that everi singl event in the bibl is exactli true and that there is a ration explan for it all that can be justifi by us the law of physic for exampl there ar a few chap who ar try to prove that the ag of the univers is year old and that the error in convent calcul is the result of the fact that the speed light ha been rapidli decai over the year and thi ha not been account for the book sai that jesu wa either a liar or he wa crazi a modern dai koresh or he wa actual who he said he wa or of cours that he never exist and the bibl wa a stori and wa never intend to becom a manifesto for a billion peopl did toni follow that on up some reason why he wouldn t be a liar ar as follow who would die for a lie wouldn t peopl be abl to tell if he wa a liar peopl gather around him and kept do it mani gather from hear or see someon who wa or had been heal million of peopl have di for a lie thi point is difficult to substanti sinc it is not well defin a great mani religi argument work in that wai but consid the mani aztec warrior who sacrif themselv to their god in the belief that thi act would bring them victori of the spanish invad the list is endless the aztec lost btw call me a fool but i believ he did heal peopl that is perfectli reason but it is not ground for me or anyon to becom a christian more to the point it doe not add weight to the claim that jesu wa the real thing niether wa he a lunat would more than an entir nation be drawn to someon who wa crazi veri doubt in fact redicul for exampl anyon who is drawn to david koresh is obvious a fool logic peopl see thi right awai have you ever seen a documentari about the rise of nazi germani more to the point did toni mention thi on could hardli call werner heisenberg and hi mani colleagu fool or illog men their support of hitler wa base i presum upon an emot issu rather than a ration agreement with hi principl obvious my argument is invalid if toni thought that hitler wa sane therefor sinc he wasn t a liar or a lunat he must have been the real thing hmmm i don t think hi argument warrant the us of a therefor some other thing to note he fulfil load of propheci in the psalm isaiah and elsewher in hr alon thi in hi betray and crucifixion i don t have my bibl with me at thi moment next time i write i will us it thi is unfortun what alot of religi discuss i have had with peopl result in quot the bibl the onli reason wai i think peopl can look at the bibl is to treat the stori as some sort of metaphor represent of the messag that the author were try to present if someon tri to interpret part of the bibl liter he or she will end up in all sort of shit toni s argument would be perfectli reason for peopl who believ the event describ in the bibl took place but to convinc someon who think the bibl is total fiction that jesu is real by quot the book is total pointless for exampl in mathemat you cannot sai a is equal to b becaus a is equal to b i don t think most peopl understand what a christian is that would possibl explain why there have so mani peopl be kill in religi war and why there ar hundr of differ version all claim to be correct it is certainli not what i see a lot in church rather i think it should be a wai of life and a total sacrafic of everyth for god s sake he love us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hei we can t do it god himself inspir us to turn our live over to him that s tuff and most peopl don t want to do it to be a real christian would be someth for the strong to persever at but just like weight lift or guitar plai drum whatev it take time we don t rush it in on dai christian is your whole life it is not go to church onc a week or help poor peopl onc in a while we box everyth

to happen year later it is not a propheci about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about jesu matthew ha made us of a vers out of context and tri to make it fit the specif case of mari it should be note that if we want to read the propheci in a gener manner a veri gener on it can be made to fit mari mari virgin or not wa inde a young woman with child of cours the fit is shadi and ha problem jesu while thought of by later christian to be g d walk among men wa never call by the name immanuel if christian wish to claim thi propheci for jesu it becom at best a cut and past propheci a second class propheci not too convinc egypt after jesu s birth in bethlehem matthew tell about a quick and elsewher unment excurs to egypt as if he wish to liken jesu to mose thi wa done to escap an alleg infanticid rampag of the king herod mt and remain there until the death of herod thi wa to fulfil what the lord had spoken out of egypt i have cal led my son what the lord realli said wa thi hosea when israel wa a child i love him and out of egypt i call my son the more i call them my peopl the more thei went from me thei kept sacrif to the ba al and kept burn incens to idol matthew conveni omit the rest of hosea s oracl but it wa inde israel that onc call out of egypt want to return thi is histori jesu is certainli not be spoken of here and if we ar to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesu that flee and resist g d again thi propheci is just not as convinc as matthew probabl had hope rachel weep while jesu is off vacat in egypt matthew sai that king herod sought to kill him and thu order the execut of all young male children matthew then write mt by thi that which wa spoken by the prophet jeremiah wa fulfil a voic wa heard in ramah wail and loud lament rachel weep for her children she refus to be consol becaus thei were no more the refer is to a passag in jeremiah refer to the carri off of israel into exil by sargon of assyria in bce rachel the ancestor of the major tribe of israel ephraim and manasseh is said to weep for her descend who ar no more it is metaphor of cours sinc rachel live and di befor the hebrew were even in the egyptian exil it is interest to note that it wa leah not rachel who wa the ancestor of the judean the land where jesu and bethlehem were if anyon should do weep for her children it is leah the onli connexion that rachel ha with bethlehem is that the legend have it that she wa buri north of the citi on the wai to ephrath bethlehem as for herod and hi infanticid it is rather unlik that such an event actual occur on never know but the event is not mention or allud to anywher els in the bibl nor is it mention in ani of the secular record of the time herod wa particularli unlik in hi reign and mani far less evil deed of herod were carefulli record thi might be a prime exampl of how event were ad to jesu s life to enhanc the messag of the church s gospel becaus of the whole stori s similar to the tale of the infant mose in egypt it is highli like that it is a devic set up by matthew to add prophet yet artifici approv of jesu it is not surpris that matthew conveni neglect to mention the rest of the jeremiah quot the children the prophet speak of ar not dead but exil in the assyrian empir g d comfort the weep rachel sai that the children will be return he will gather them back togeth of cours thi would not suit matthew s purpos as the children he speak of ar dead for good again the propheci matthew set up is not even that and to anyon who bother to check it out is not too convinc the nazaren we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find anoth matthean propheci after leav egypt joseph wife take the infant jesu to live in the citi of nazareth mt that what wa spoken of by the prophet might be fulfil he shall be call a nazaren first thing we notic is that matthew doe not mention the name of the prophet s thi time second we have to ask who he is there ar no messian propheci speak of a nazaren wors there ar no propheci period mention a nazaren still wors there ar no nazaren mention in the old testament at all in the book of judg an angel tell samson s mother that she will judg conceiv and bear a son no razor shall tough hi head for he will be a nazirit to hi god from the dai of hi birth he will deliv israel from the hand of the philistin thi is of cours not a propheci of jesu or the messiah of g d but it is the best that can be found obvious matthew ha begun to go overboard in cut and past propheci in that he is simpl make them up now bear our diseas jesu next goe around heal peopl of physic ill and disabl mt thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet isaiah he took our infirm and bore our diseas as expect the vers quot in isaiah is quot out of context and a few word ar skew to fit the christian scheme we have is sure he the suffer servant ha born our sick and carri our pain from a read of the surround passag in isaiah we know that the prophet is speak in present tens of the collect nation of israel jehovah s chosen servant and peopl he speak to the israelit suffer in exil in the voic of the gentil nation that look upon it thi imag is deepli ingrain in jewish ident an imag of a chastis yet cherish israel as the instrument of the nation salvat by g d the vers speak of israel take on the sick which ar the liter and metaphor manifest of guilt and disciplin thei do not speak of a servant go around and heal peopl notic that the servant in isaiah take on the sick and pain of the nation and individu jew jesu as we all know did not take the diseas onto himself the vers here in isaiah ar not a propheci of someth to come but rather someth that had alreadi happen while it is believ that jesu took on the etern punish of hell he did not bear the ill he heal so while someon might want to sai that figur jesu reenact the deed of israel in hi spiritu aton he ha to admit that matthew s parallel miss where he intend it to have it effect silent messiah upon heal multitud of common it is said that jesu order them to keep quiet presum so that he wouldn t arous the attent of the local ruler mt thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet isaiah behold my servant whom i have chosen my belov with whom my soul is pleas i will put my spirit on him and he will announc justic to the gentil he will not wrangl or cry aloud nor will anyon hear hi voic in the street he will not break a bruis reed or quench a smolder wick until he bring justic to victori and the gentil will hope in hi name the isaiah passag quot read is behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delight i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justic to the nation we will not cry or lift up hi voic or make it heard in the street he will not break a bruis reed or quench a smolder wick he will faithfulli bring forth justic he will not fail burn dimli or be discourag bruis until he ha establish justic in the earth and the coastland await hi law you see matthew ha conveni left out part of the passag becaus it doe not suit the deal of jesu christian could never think of jesu fail never would the light of mankind burn dimli but the servant nation of israel will inde come to an end when it job is done when the gentil come to embrac g d there will no longer be a chosen peopl but rather all will be the children of g d also the end phrase ha been chang from the judaic the coastland await hi law to the christolog the gentil will hope in hi name while the origin proclaim the torah law of jehovah the other rewrit it to fit it strang doctrin of believ in the name if on ha ani doubt the servant refer to is not jesu on ha onli to read the whole chapter isaiah and hear about the belov but blind and imperfect servant a peopl rob and plunder so we see that when matthew s attempt at propheci is examin it crumbl three dai and three night now we come upon a propheci supposedli utter by the veri mouth of the god jesu himself he speak of hi crucifixion and resurrect mt for as jonah wa in the belli of the whale for three dai and three night so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three dai and three night befor ani further discuss can occur it is necessari to know how the jew understood dai as far as dai name went each wa hour long last from sunset pm to the follow sunset pm what wa refer to as a dai wa the period of light from am to the end sunset at pm thu accord to our time scale a sabbath dai began at pm fridai even and last until pm saturdai even thi is why the jew celebr their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturdai instead of sundai it seem like a real miracl that christian didn t forget that saturdai wa inde the seventh and last dai of the week thu when dai and night ar refer to togeth hour daylight portion and hour night period ar be spoken of thu jesu sai that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwis unresurrect for three dai and three night as the good book tell us jesu wa crucifi on the ninth hour which is pm fridai afternoon he then wa put into the grave sometim after that then jesu left the grave rose befor dawn of what we call sundai the dawn after the sabbath wa over what thi mean is that jesu wa us our time for clariti in the grave from pm fridai night to some time befor am sundai morn we could also add a littl time befor pm fridai sinc the bibl is not specif here what thi mean us jewish time is that he wa in the grave for on dai two night and possibl a coupl of hour of on dai certainli thi is a problem for jesu predict there is absolut no wai we ar even abl to have hi death involv three dai and three night even us modern time measur we then ar led to suspect that thi error is anoth on of matthew s littl mistak and that the gospel writer put fals word into hi god s mouth and no matter who made the predict it is more than unconvinc it is counter convinc hear understand jesu tool on a habit of speak to hi vast audienc in parabl stori in which a deeper mean could be found if you were alreadi on of the elect those chosen to understand the messag of jesu he reason that those who can understand the parabl ar the on he want if the peopl cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them sinc thei will not accept the plain messag ani better matthew sai mt with them the audienc inde in fulfil the propheci of isaiah which sai you will inde hear but never understand and you will inde see but never perceiv becaus thi peopl s heart ha grown dull their ear ar heavi of hear and thei have shut their ey so the thei would not perceiv with them her with their ear and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them the origin isaiah passag ar part of hi earlier work hi call to the ministri thi is in bce when israel is flourish right befor it fall under the author of assyria isaiah see the good time end and also a vision from g d call him to bring reform to israel and judah is and g d said go and sai to thi peopl hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceiv make the heart of thi peopl fat make their ear heavi and shut their ey so thei will not see with their ey or hear with their ear and understand with their heart and turn and be heal then isaiah said how long lord and he said until the citi lie wast without inhabit and hous without men and the land is utterli desol and the g ds take men far awai and forsaken place ar mani in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burn again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stand when the tree is fell the holi seed is it stump here we see that it is realli g d who caus the peopl of israel to stop listen to the prophet s warn but reaffirm the promis made to solomon s and david s seed lineag if you read the rest of isaiah you find that thi is done to fulfil the plan of g d to us israel as a servant a light to the nation look at isaiah we see that matthew ha cut and past just a littl portion of isaiah s vers to suit hi own gospel need more than that he ha alter the word to make it fit the peopl who didn t understand jesu s stori and as we see isaiah s vers ar not propheci but rather command from g d to him in the present onc again matthew s propheci fall flat on it face matthew tri again to make jesu s parabl look like thei have the prophet approv mt he said noth to them without a parabl thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in parabl i will utter that which ha been hidden sinc the foundat of the world matthew realli botch up here he attempt to quot not from a prophet but from the psalm ps i will open my mouth in parabl i will utter dark sai of old thing that we all have heard and known thing that our father have told us we will not hide them from their children but tell to the come gener the gloriou deed of the lord as wa point out the vers in the psalm do not realli come from a prophet you might also want to know that earlier copi of matthew s gospel even insert isaiah s name as thi prophet appar later scribe caught the error and tri to cover some of it up perhap the most signific part of thi is that onc again matthew ha alter the old testament scriptur as jesu ha said earlier he speak in parabl so that some will not understand them the parabl in the psalm ar not to be hidden further thei speak of thing known that our father have told us jesu deal with thing hidden sinc the foundat of the world inde jesu dealt in a lot of secreci and confus thi is in direct opposit to the parabl in the psalm no wonder matthew had to rewrit them and still onc again matthew s artifici propheci fall flat on their face but christian rare look at thi matthew s propheci aren t the onli thing about christian that ar begin to look bad excus of littl faith in mt we see that the discipl ar abl to go around cast out demon except in on case not know what epilepsi wa the peopl thought those with the diseas were posses with demon it is no wonder that the discipl were unabl to dispossess the epilept but jesu perhap no more enlighten than thei is report to have rebuk them sai thei didn t have enough faith thi seem strang why wa thi demon special it seem that either a true believ ha faith or he doe not appar enough faith will allow someon to move mountain of cours you will find no on these dai that can move real mountain no on part sea the onli miracl the charismat can speak of ar those rumour to happen on trip to mexico or some farawai place major miracl ar make some old woman s arthriti feel better on sundai morn t v and the god includ jesu ar alwai shroud in ancient lore and write protect from the skeptic in their sacr past thei ar either dead sleep or hide in heaven with peopl rumour about their immin return and their great miracl of dai long gone yet life goe on tale of mystic stori of miracl all in a distant time or a distant place god us to reveal themselv to men in the old dai jehovah too but now thei ar silent all the theologian give ar variou excus as to why we don t get to see god anymor we re too lazi we re not zealou enough we re sin it s just hi plan we put too mani of our own demand on g d s appear if we had the right faith if we were will to meet g d on hi term yet even the most piou of men have not seen g d you dear reader have not seen g d not liter you know that to be true i know that s presumptu and bold but search your heart you know what i mean all that we ve seen religion do is make peopl feel good and content about not see g d thei sai our littl faith doe not merit us to see g d sometim thei sai see the love in these peopl you worship with see the live of peopl chang that is see g d thu peopl get lull to sleep satisfi with turn g d into the everydai sight but that is not see g d as i am speak of it is not see g d the wai peopl us to see what we see in the world that is good is the compass of human heart the love given and taken by men and women the forgiv practis by christian atheist alik beauti creat by the mind of man these ar the thing that ar done these ar what we see but it is said thi is so onli becaus everybodi ha littl faith jesu ride on an ass shortli after accept the role of the jewish messiah king jesu request a donkei be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem mt thi took place to fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet sai tell the daughter of zion behold your king is come to you humbl mount on an ass and on a ass colt of cours the passag quot from zechariah read a littl differ lo your king come to you he is triumphant and victori humbl and ride on an ass on an ass colt he will command peac to the nation there isn t all that much differ here except that zechariah onli involv on anim an ass colt while matthew read the poetic word slightli differ thu he ha jesu call for both a colt and an adult ass from matthew s version we get a comic pictur of the divin christ sweat it to straddl two donkei thi could inevit lead to a theolog proctolog dilemma we find that in the account written earlier by st mark onli the colt wa call for and brought to jesu thi inde fit the vers of zechariah properli and show us that in matthew attempt to us prophet vers he ha bungl now exclud mani respect christian i have met i have notic that while christ is thought to have ridden on ass the situat is often revers nowadai then enter the jerusalem templ the priest were anger at peopl and youngster call jesu the messiah but jesu repli as we might expect matthew to have done mt haven t you read out of the mouth of babe and suckl thou ha brought perfect prais it is more like that matthew made thi respons up sinc jesu wa never on to point out such littl prophet thing and sinc as we might expect the quot is in error which seem to fit matthew s track record quit well we might ask jesu or matthew haven t you read for the sourc read psalm o yahweh our lord how majest is your name in the whole world you whose glori is chant abov the heaven by babe and infant you have found a bulwark against your foe to still the enemi and the aveng the passag hardli need comment there is no perfect prais spoken of in the psalm and what prais is there is given to g d not hi messiah king and not jesu as mention it seem to be just on more case of matthew s pen make up conveni prophet scriptur yhvh said to my lord jesu is said to have ask from whom the promis jewish messiah king is to be descend the jew agre it is king david but then jesu counter by quot psalm the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemi under your feet taken at face valu jesu is deni the necess of david descent on assum he is in opposit to their answer of cours the christian answer is that he agre but is try to make some hidden point to reveal some mysteri about the divin natur of the messiah king it s tempt to believ thi if on is a christian and not interest in matter of investig but there ar problem in jesu s time the psalm wa thought to be about the messiah and it is easi to see why david might refer to the messiah as hi superior we need onli look at the scriptur about the messiah to see that he is expect to be a great king bring the jew to time even better than those under david s rule of cours the jew listen had no good answer and the passag could inde refer to a divin messiah such as the christian worship the problem li in the mean of thi psalm an error that appar sever jew of jesu s time had also made on must rememb that there were variou faction among the jew often as a result of differ expect of the messiah king jesu wa appar on of these adventist like hi audienc who thought the messiah s advent wa immin and who interpret psalm among other as be messian what is the problem then psalm liter read yhvh s utter to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemi your footstool yhvh send forth your mighti scepter from zion rule in the midst of your foe your peopl will offer themselv freeli on the dai you lead your host on the holi mountain you ar a priest of the order of melchizedek forev the word lord is often mistakenli capitalis by christian bibl to denot divin in thi lord but in the hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalis exist adoni simpli mean lord a gener term as we would us it it is us often in the scriptur to refer to king and to g d it is mere an address of respect there is noth in the text itself to impli that the word refer either to divin or to the messiah king that thi is suppos to be written by david is not certain the titl of the psalm translat to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david it seem fit to assum it to be written by a court poet about david s coven and endors from g d if the psalm had been written by david it is unlik that he would be talk about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descend from david wa not present in david s ag we have extens tale of david s do and sai none of which includ ani prais of a messiah mani of the psalm show evid of be written long after david wa dead in time of the exil when g d had put hi show of favour for david s kingdom on hold the descript in the psalm fit david veri well david wa promis by g d a rise to power victori over hi enemi success judgement among the nation he conquer he achiev the priesthood common to melchizedek in be a righteou king enabl to bless the peopl it all fit we do not have to blame thi problem on matthew alon though here there is not artifici propheci allud to though hi us of the scriptur is rather question still thi event is common to the other gospel too so we let matthew off a littl more easili thi time it is interest to note though how matthew dress up the event the earlier gospel of mark tell the tale with jesu simpli speak to a crowd matthew ha the pharise who becam the religi competit of an infant christian be the target of jesu s question as we might expect matthew write that the event end up by embarrass the pharise such power is the pen mose jesu had it togeth all along we leav the gospel stori of matthew momentarili to see a pseudo propheci in john s gospel the gospel stori of john deserv special treatment becaus it seem to be so far remov from the real event of jesu s career as told by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at on vers the earli church leader found a religion on the jewish hope of a messiah king and on an artifici extens of the origin promis made by g d when construct the histori of abraham mose wrote of a promis of land and nationhood to the jewish peopl while thi wa accomplish eventu under the rule of king david the christian who came along later decid that thei would claim the fulfil of the promis but to do so thei expand on the promis preach about a heavenli kingdom john j c speak your father abraham rejoic to see my dai he sai it and wa glad it would be nice to tie in approv for jesu from abraham but abraham knew noth of jesu or a messiah or anyth christian i have tri and fail to find ani event in the old testament which correspond to john s littl propheci it is par for the cours to see st john make up old testament back just like hi forerunn matthew mani christian know that their faith ha mani of it foundat in such fraud and it is surpris thei still cling to it the potter s field we ar told that jesu wa betrai while in jerusalem by on of hi follow juda iscariot matthew write mt and throw down the piec of silver in the templ juda depart but the chief priest take the silver said it isn t law for us to put it in the treasuri sinc it is blood monei so thei bought a potter s field with it to buri stranger in then wa fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet jeremiah and thei took the thirti piec of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the son of israel and thei gave them for the potter s field as the lord direct me thi propheci is an utterli gross bastardis of old testament scriptur first matthew ha made a mistak regard the name of the prophet it is zechariah who utter the vers which matthew make us of zech and thei weigh out my wage thirti shekel of silver then yhvh said to me cast them to the treasuri the lordli price at which i wa paid off by them so i took the thirti shekel of silver and cast them into the treasuri in the hous of yhvh first of all the vers of zechariah do not deal with a betray of the messiah or of g d the deal with a shepherd most like a priest chosen to serv a function of presid over the peopl shortli befor g d would send judah and israel into conflict with on anoth the word treasuri had been replac by the king jame scholar with to the potter precis becaus thi made matthew s quot fit better but thi is a blatant error the correct translat of the hebrew is inde treasuri which also make perfect sens in zechariah s context wherea potter s field is total unrel whether the mistransl wa intent or not seem to be beyond specul howev given matthew s track record on find it hard to resist the notion of intent dishonesti of cours matthew would have ampl reason for alter the text the thirti piec of silver match juda s situat and if as most christian seem to be the reader is will to disregard the contextu incongru matthew might have anoth propheci to toss around howev the correct translat of zechariah directli contradict the situat with juda and the high priest the high priest would not put the monei in the treasuri the worthless shepherd of zechariah doe exactli the opposit of cours to the averag thursdai night bibl student the propheci as present by matthew would be taken at new testament face valu to those matthew s work is convinc enough wine vinegar cast lot then jesu is led awai to be crucifi mt thei gave him vinegar to drink mingl with gall but when he tast it he would not drink it and when thei had crucifi him thei divid hi garment among them by cast lot that it might be fulfil what wa spoken by the prophet thei part my garment among them and upon my vestur did thei cast lot first of all the vinegar offer to jesu is actual common sour wine of the type that roman soldier drank regularli we find that right befor jesu di the soldier themselv give him some to drink not pollut with gall jn jesu said i thirst a bowl of vinegar stood there so thei put a spong full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to hi mouth when he had receiv the vinegar he said it is finish but matthew seem to be draw on not a passag from the prophet but on from the psalm ps i look for piti but there wa none and for comfort but i found none thei gave me poison for food lit thei put gall in my meat and for my thirst thei gave me vinegar to drink add to them punish upon punish mai thei have no acquitt from thee let them be blot out of the book of the live of cours the sour wine offer to jesu is done at hi request of drink thi doe inde seem to be a show of piti the psalm quot is about david and hi polit and militari enemi it is not about the messiah or jesu it is then not surpris that we run into further problem when we see that the jesu in the psalm ask g d for the damnat of the crucifi wherea the jesu of the gospel sai lk jesu said father forgiv them the don t know what thei do further matthew miss with hi attempt to creat propheci by have gall a bitter substanc put into jesu s drink not hi meat as the psalm stipul with the propheci of the vinegar faulti we natur ask what of the cast of lot thi bring up the nd psalm which deserv discuss all by itself suffic it now to sai that the fact that jesu s cloth were divid as told is no great thing it turn out that thi happen often to ani felon in those dai as we will soon see it is perhap the least erron passag of the psalm when appli to jesu it doe inde bring up the interest question as to the qualiti of jesu s cloth for a man so remov from worldli possess hi ownership of cloth worthi of cast lot rais some suspicion the nd psalm thi psalm is attribut to david as a lament of hi condit under the attack of hi enemi it becom a song of prais to yhvh and of hope taken out of context part of it seem to fit the plight of jesu at the crucifixion quit well we will examin the primari passag vers my god my god why have you forsaken me why ar you so far from help me far from the word of my groan oh my god i cry by dai but you don t answer and by night but find no rest jesu is said to have cri the first sentenc while on the cross thi suggest that the whole psalm is realli about jesu rather than king david of cours the rest of the first stanza doe not fit as nice to jesu or hi execut jesu is not pictur as complain about the whole ordeal he is suppos to be like the lamb led mute befor it shearer inde jesu doesn t do much groan even when on the cross he certainli doe not cry by both dai and night on the cross but i am a worm and no man scorn by men all who see me mock at me thei make face and wag their head he commit hi caus to yhvh so let him deliv him for he delight in him thi seem to fit jesu s execut pretti well with the except of the holi messiah be call a worm mani bull encompass me thei open their mouth wide at me like a raven and roar lion yea dog ar round about me a compani of evildo encir cle me thei have pierc my hand and feet i can see all my bone thei divid my garment among them and cast lost for my raiment but you yhvh be not far awai deliv my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflict soul from the horn of the wild bull it would seem quit convinc and i m sure the earli christian father who wrote of thi propheci thought so too unfortun thi propheci ha a fatal flaw the word have pierc realli do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translat is yea dog ar round about me a compani of evildo encircl me like the lion thei ar at my hand and feet in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a veri rare verb form which can mean pierc differ by on phonet charact the word in the hebrew text is liter like the lion ka ari which make sens in the context and even further fit the anim imageri emploi by the psalm writer it is conveni that would urg a christian to chang the word to ka aru but to add the need yet artifici weight to the propheci thi is just what the christian translat have chosen to do while the correct translat doe not elimin the psalm from refer to jesu it absenc doe not sai much for the honesti of the translat apart from the erron vers the psalm doe not lend itself to jesu so easili vers speak of the suffer be save from a sword rather than a cross thi natur fit the psalm s true subject king david as a side note we now know that crucifixion did not pierc the hand the palm but rather the forearm thi doesn t sai much in favour of the tradit thought of a resurrect jesu show hi discipl the scar on hi palm but then fact aren t bound by our religi belief matthew escap culpabl thi time as he doe not attempt to draw mani direct link between thi psalm and hi lord jesu but the psalm like mani other wa on the mind of all the gospel writer when thei compil the stori and interpret of jesu s life and death how much these scriptur mai have contribut to what actual got written down is a question that ha seriou repercuss for christian theologi it is easi to see for those who ar not faith fundamentalist how some of the event in the new testament might have been enhanc by scribe such as the eager matthew but it doe less to specul than to simpli investig scriptur matter and prophet claim so far thi ha not said good thing for st matthew the refer to the pierc look a lot like jesu s crucifixion john s gospel recount written about year after the fact tell us at jesu s execut jn but on of the soldier pierc hi side with a spear and out came blood and water these thing took place that scriptur be fulfil the will look on him whom thei ve pierc of cours thi is built on a passag taken blatantli out of context prophet zechariah tell us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc and yhvh will give victori to judah and on that dai i will seek to destroi the nation that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pour a spirit of compass and supplic on jerusalem so that when thei look on him who thei have pierc thei will mourn and weep bitterli over him like you weep over a firstborn child john s attempt to make up propheci is perhap weaker that matthew s attempt matthew at least usual excontext more than just on passag john s error ar grossli obviou and blatant here it doe not speak well for ani of the gospel writer as it help to show how the prophet aspect of their religion were found reckon with transgressor after hi arrest jesu is quickli execut for claim the jewish kingship messiahship accord to on version of the gospel tale jesu get execut along with two thiev mk and with him thei crucifi two robber on on hi right on on hi left and so the scriptur wa fulfil which sai he wa reckon with the transgressor here mark is try to link jesu to a passag in isaiah about the servant nation of israel the passag is not about the messiah for if on read the whole chapter of isaiah and it surround chapter on see that the servant is a nation the vers ar also about what thi servant ha gone through in the past not a predict of what is to come in ani event the servant is thought of as a crimin thi also happen to fit the descript of jesu had the passag realli been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why execut jesu between two thiev would fulfil the propheci in isaiah jesu would more fittingli fulfil it with hi whole ministri he wa consid a blasphem and troublemak all throughout hi career lock onto a singl event is a rather poor wai to steal propheci at least in thi case as we see that mark could have had made a better analog with gener comparison mark goe on to tell us how those who were crucifi with jesu also revil him thi is to be expect from a coupl of robber of cours in hi later recount st luke decid to chang some thing luke tell us lk and on of the crimin who wa hang with him rail aren t you the messiah save yourself and us thi certainli fit with mark s recount which tell how the peopl who crucifi jesu said save yourself and that the robber did the same but then luke goe on but the other crimin rebuk the first sai don t you fear g d sinc you ar under the same sentenc of condemn and we inde justli so for we ar receiv the due reward for our deed but thi man ha done noth wrong and he said jesu rememb me when you come in your kingdom and jesu answer verili i sai to you todai you will be with me in paradis now thi littl dialogu seem highli contriv it stretch the imagin a bit to see thi pictur of on ruffian rebuk hi fellow crimin with such eloqu speech we have a rather strang pictur of a crimin lament over the good of hi punish and the just of hi suffer such a man appar nobl and of principl doesn t seem like to have been a robber we wonder at the amount of theatric creat by luke of cours luke s recount also disagre with mark s luke ha onli on crimin revil jesu not both it is easi enough to discount the discrep becaus the account wa made up but those who wish to believ it is all part of the error free word of g d do not have thi avenu open thi is yet anoth exampl of a writer try to take an old testament passag and expand it and reinterpret it to suit hi theologi in thi case the embroideri creat some embarrass problem as we have seen the end of the world mt now come perhap on of the most extraordinari and embarrass passag in the new testament it is found in all three of the synopt gospel stori and cast some of the most unfavour doubt on the whole theori of christian jesu mention the destruct of the jewish templ and build and hi discipl ask him about thi and about the end of the world which he ha been warn about the discipl tell us when will thi the templ s destruct be and what will be the sign of your come and of the close of the ag jesu take care that no on lead you astrai for mani will come in my name sai i am the christ you will hear of war and rumour of war for thi must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation all thi is but the begin of the birthpang thei will deliv you up put you to death and fals prophet will aris and lead mani astrai but he who endur to the end will be save thi gospel will be preach throughout the whole world a testimoni to the nation and then the end will come so when you see the desol spoken of by the prophet daniel let those who ar in judea flee to the mountain immedi after the tribul of those dai the sun will be darken the star will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribe of the earth will mourn and see the son of man come and he will send out hi angel and gather hi elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as it branch becom tender and put forth leav you know that summer is near so also when you see all these thing you will know that he is near at the veri gate truli i sai to you thi gener will not pass awai until all these thing take place but of the dai and hour no on know not the angel not the son but onli the father therefor you also must be readi for the son of man is come at an hour you do not expect from thi it is clear that jesu thought the world would in within the lifetim of at least some of hi discipl he tell them that although he doesn t know the exact dai or hour that it will come and thu thei must be readi theologian have wet their pant in panic to find some wai out of thi holi error but unfortun jesu made himself to explicit he told hi discipl that their gener would still be around at the end and that thei in particular should prepar for it prepar to be swept awai there have been some who resort to remov the inerr natur of the bibl and said that the phrase thi gener shall not pass awai realli mean thi race of peopl will not pass awai of cours the word for gener is us mani time to refer to exactli that the gener of the discipl it is an interest notion that when god decid to learn greek he didn t learn it well enough to make himself clear but it is quit obviou from the rest of the dialogu that the discipl at least some of them ar suppos to live to the end of the world the charg of mistransl is complet blown awai by look at the apostl respons it becom abundantli clear from rev peter john and rev that jesu meant exactli what he said the end wa veri near for year christian have rationalis thi th chapter of matthew or ignor it mean altogeth for year thei have wait for their execut leader to come back hear of war and rumour of war sure that he is come soon sure he must be all we must do is wait can you imagin how tire he must be sit around up there be holi wait for just the right moment to spring so shortli after hi crucifixion jesu of nazareth joshua ben joseph di it is said that after three dai or three dai and three night or three period of time or three etern second or three of whatev thei can decid make for less troubl he wa seen again resurrect glow with divin radianc then the saviour decid it wasn t in the best interest of hi new religion to stick around and therefor disappear from sight into heaven so the stori goe anywai as ha been seen there were mani thing attribut to jesu when peopl got around to write the gospel stori down to them jesu wa the fulfil of all propheci and scriptur we have seen though that thi matter is quit shaki but throughout church histori christian have held fast to faith in simpl belief what doctrin object could not be solv with argument or brute forc faith and forget kept awai from question to question and investig ha never been the easiest wai to treat matter thu for year the propheci cite in the new testament have gone on larg accept thing mai well continu that wai for some time paus a moment to consid the wai the doctrin of christian have been accept and us properli or improperli to support war and persecut i suppos there is on propheci of which christian

mine wa publish in serdar argic s wa in no need to us the same book size and the same letter characht in both public etc etc doe it give you an idea the issu wa not the number of page the book ha or the year first publish and you tri to hide the whole point the point is that both book have the exactli the same quot about how moslem ar kill tortur etc by armenian and those quot given by serdar argic exist it wa the issu wasn t it you were not abl to object it doe it bother you anywai you name all these tortur and murder by armenian as a crap peopl who think like you ar among the main reason

       " 'mr decenso in spite of requir scholarli opinion on the hang of juda reject that the scholarli opinion of the those scholar and then rephras those scholar opinion on the subject we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and act probabl record hi death although it s possibl and plausibl that he fell from the hang and hit some rock therebi burst open i can no longer assum that to be the case therefor no contradict matthew did not sai juda di as a result of the hang did he most scholar believ he iprob did but i quot all that to show that i highli regard the scholar explan but in look at the text initi we can t assum juda di it is howev highli probabl and also there is noth in the greek to suggest success or failur it simpli mean hang oneself actual if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will find that it doe denot success those scholar did inde have an excel reason to assum that the suicid wa success as i point out i recent check sever lexicon greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm word studi concord tynsdal a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other earli christian write bauer arndt gingrich the new analyt greek lexicon perschbach a coupl simpli state hang oneself and a coupl were more explicit and state that apacgw mean specif kill yourself by hang a coupl also note that the mean of on the root word for apacgw is strangl throttl or choke which pretti much invalid the gui who suggest to david joslin that juda wa hung upsid down on of the best refer though robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament not onli state the translat it gave both the root word the liter translat relat greek word which us the same root and also other present specif exampl of the word in greek literatur to give further context the word apagchw ha two root word gchw is the to strangl root and the root word apo mean liter awai thi root word is includ in word which denot a transit it can mean a transit in place eg the greek word apagello mean to send a messag apo can also denot a chang in state and specif the chang from life to death robinson specif make comparison to the word apokteiuo which mean to kill in liter mean the word apacgw mean to throttl strangl to put out of the wai and implicitli denot a chang in life state ie awai from life to death so while the word apacgw doe mean to hang it specif denot a death as well thu robinson is quit specif when he state that it mean to hang oneself to end on s life by hang he then note the the us of apacgw in homer odessi to denot context he present that exampl of apacgw as be us to explicitli mean suicid by hang now sinc there is a perfectli good word for strangl without the ad denot of death and as you insist that the bibl wa written by god and everi word is precic correct you ar stuck with the complet mean of apacgw ie sinc the word apacgw wa us then death is denot as the result by the wai i note that mr decenso also present an exampl of apacgw in the septuagint the greek translat of the ot us at the time of jesu it s onli us in samuel now when ahithophel saw that hi advic wa not follow he saddl a donkei and aros and went home to hi hous to hi citi then he put hi household in order and hang himself and di and he wa buri in hi father s tomb notic that not onli is it state that ahithophel hang himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitli add and di here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we ar not explicitli told juda di note mr decenso as you sai the septuagint wa a translat from hebrew to greek and you have not shown the origin mean of the hebrew ie the the hebrew sai and di and thu whether it wa simpli echo in the greek it should also be point out that regardless of the ad and di the correct translat would still be apacgw as the man did inde die from strangul redund but correct further we have evid that the septuagint wa repeatedli rewritten and reedit which includ version which contradict each other and such edit wa not even necessarili execut by greek thu i am not sure that you can us the septuagint as it now stand as a paragon of ancient greek so what you realli need to prove your point mr decenso is an exampl in ancient greek of someon commit apacgw and surviv otherwis i would see you as simpli make worthless assert without correspond evid now i would note mr decenso that everytim i go out of my wai to research it on of your appar contriv exegisi i pretti much find it fals thu i think that if you ar go to add to the text someth over and abov what the sourc clearli sai then you had better have an explicit greek or histor sourc to justifi it by the wai as to mr rose s statement about tree around the potter s field there ar still tree around the ledg and a rocki pavement at the bottom unless mr rose can show that these tree ar two thousand year old or that there ar year old stump there or ha a thousand year old descript of the area which mention such tree then it is inappropri for him to assert that the present placement of tree prove the locat of the tree two thousand year ago after all thing chang now as to your other argument ie that the monei juda us is not the same as the silver as to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the monei with which juda purchas the land wa inde for the betray rather than some other sourc i would point out that in act where it specif mention the reward of iniqu act it also specif mention what act of iniqu thei were talk about ie act concern juda who wa guid to those who arrest jesu now i would point out that when the bibl describ an act of iniqu and then immedi discuss the reward of iniqu it would be rather inan to suggest that it wa an action of iniqu other than the on discuss notic that in vers the word iniqu is not us rather it state that juda becam a guid to those who arrest jesu but the writer did not stop there vs for he wa number with us and obtain a part in thi ministri what part did juda plai in their ministri true peter or the author of act doe not specif call juda betray an iniqu but for that matter neither doe john specif call juda action an iniqu either further john did not sai that juda took the monei box but rather said some thought that becaus juda had the monei box jesu wa tell him bui what we need for the feast or that he should give someth to the poor so after receiv the morsel he immedi went out and it wa night note that it is said that juda left it doe not sai that he took the monei box thu when i see your explan it still seem to me you would choos the a an unproven iniqu mention by anoth author in a differ book written at a differ time over the iniqu explicitli mention by the author of act i find thi forc and contriv of cours thi particular argument becom moot sinc we have have seen evid that apacgw mean suicid you see sinc juda hang wa success he could not have spent the monei mention in john becaus matthew and mark explicitli sai the betray wa on the high holi dai ie passov and thu he could not have spent the monei befor kill himself the next dai thu the monei which bought the field of blood would have to have been the piec of silver of cours he got the piec of silver that night as well and thu couldn t have spent that either oh dear i believ that the hous of card is com down mayb we should at thi point discuss now whether jesu wa crucifi on fridai or saturdai as that is now part of the argument about juda by the wai as to where the prophesi of the potter s field came from ie the mention of it in matthew you sai pleas when we ar done with thi studi on hi death remind me to discuss thi with you i am remind you now to discuss it now it s all part of the same vers we ar discuss and i wish you would quit procrastin and sidestep these issu later dave butler a wise man proport hi belief to the evid david hume
